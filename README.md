# The project is under development.
# Carla Reinforcement Learning Autonomous Driving Agent

Inspiration: Mitigate motion blur and better adaptability to drastic lighting conditions, rain, wind, and poor visibility.

Approach: Fusing RGB, DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor), and Depth sensors. Using Reinforcement Learning for training the agent in the carla enviorenment with random weather.

Current Goal: Event Based Sensor Fusion with RGB-D
